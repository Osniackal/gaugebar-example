Gaugebar Example
================

I'm trying to always learn new stuff by writing about it over at http://slothsoft.de/

Since ZIP files are a bit unflexible and somewhat annoying to handle I want to put the source code for my tutorials
in these GIT repositories.

This example shows how to create a custom control with JavaFX, using a gauge bar as example. A step by step description can be found here: http://slothsoft.de/de/content/creating-custom-control-javafx-gauge-bar
